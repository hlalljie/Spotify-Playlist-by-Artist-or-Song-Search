Have you ever wanted to listen to a playlist, but only remembered the song or the artist, but not the playlist name?
Now you can do a search to find all of your playlists that contain a given song name or artist using Spotify's api.

To use you will need to run the api or you can run the spotifyServices functions just to test. You will also need an env file with your Spotify API key.

If you'd like a better user experience, feel free to reach out, happy to create a quick walkthrough or whip up a frontend to interact with.
